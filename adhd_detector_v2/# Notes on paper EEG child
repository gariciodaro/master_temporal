# Notes on paper EEG child

1) apply Lilliefors test to see if each features for every channel follow a normal dist (p statitic)
2) F-tests showed that the variances of every feature were
found to be equal between groups (p > 0.01, after correc-
tion)
3)The spatial distributions of power values
show symmetry in both the ADHD and control groups, and
distribution centers moved from frontal and central regions
to temporal and occipital regions as frequency increased.
4)From t-test results, we found that in all regions, the delta power of the ADHD group was significantly higher than that of
the control group (p < 0.01).
5)No channel showed a significant
difference in theta power	
6)The alpha power and beta1 power
were significantly lower in the ADHD group than in the control
group (p < 0.01)
